I am currently a graduate student at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/), at the [Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/). My research focus is on multisensory interactions, particularly on visuo-haptic interactions. I try to understand how vision and touch interact to help better understand the world around us. There's still a lot we don't fully understand about the interactions between sensory modalities. 

I am always pleased to discuss about my research and more. Feel free to connect with me :
